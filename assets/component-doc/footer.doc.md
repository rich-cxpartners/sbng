`import { SbFooterModule } from '@sb/components'` in your modules

There are 2 directives available for the footer:
- `sb-footer-links` to add some links to the right of the footer
- `sb-footer-logo` to add a logo to the left of the footer

If you add the class `normal-logo` to a logo, it will only display for large screens  
If you add the class `mini-logo` to a logo, it will only display for small screens

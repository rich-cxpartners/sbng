#### 3. Breaking changes

##### At least Angular 10
You must update your application to angular 10 or higher

##### Angular 11 / Material 11 / PrimeNg 11
As this library has been updated to Angular 11, it involves also the migration of angular material and PrimeNg dependencies.

It is not mandatory to migrate to Angular 11 right now, as we make the components provided in the showcase compatible with Angular 10 components and PrimeNG 10, but it's HIGHTLY RECOMMENDED to do it at the same time, as we can't test all components and even more the migration is not complicated.

So here are the main steps to migrate your application:

- Angular 11 / Material 11
Follow the guideline provided by Angular team, and select angular material too:

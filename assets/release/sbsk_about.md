### What is SB Starter-kit ?
We have made a Starter Kit to accelerate the creation of an angular project. Inside it, we have already included everything needed to start to develop your pages (recommended component dependencies, presets, good structure, etc ...).

### How can I use The Starter Kit ?
you can follow the documentation [HERE](https://soprabanking.io/sbng-documentation/current/sbng/how-to-start-a-new-sbng-project/)

Please note that you will take the starter kit at a given moment and you will not have any link to it then, even if it changes. It is just a starting point to accelerate your project.
